Langcli is an interactive AI coding assistant in the terminal, built upon the best practices of Claude Code. It features:
- Langcli is 100% compatible with Claude Code. Therefore, the way to use Langcli is exactly the same as that of standard Claude Code and your existing projects' .claude or skills are all applicable to Langcli. 
- Even more exciting is that Langcli is deeply integrated with [LangRouter](https://langrouter.ai/),
allowing you to friendly use and switch between mainstream LLM models (including Claude OPUS 5.5, Deepseek v4.1 flash, GLM 5.3 flash, GPT 6.1 sol, GLM 5.2, Deepseek v4 pro, Kimi K2.7 code, Minimax M3, Mimo 2.6 pro, etc.) within an ongoing session as needed, without interrupting your context.
